openSMILE uses LibSVM (by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin) for 
classification tasks. It is distributed with openSMILE and is
 included in the src/classifiers/libsvm/ directory.
See the COPYRIGHT file in that directory for details on license terms
 of LivSVM.

PortAudio is required for live recording from sound card and for 
the SEMAINE components.
You can get the latest version from: http://www.portaudio.com
However, we cannot guarantee compatibility with the latest versions.

Optionally, openSMILE can be linked against the SEMAINE API 
and the Julius LVCSR engine, enabling an interface to the 
SEMAINE system and a keyword spotter component. 
See http://www.semaine-project.eu/ for details on running the 
SEMAINE system.
Only the older versions of openSMILE (1.0.1) are officially 
supported to be built with the SEMAINE system.
For recent developments, check out the status of the ARIA VALUSPA
EU-project: http://aria-agent.eu/
-----------------------------------------

As part of the build process, a number of third-party CMake modules
are used. Please see the license notices in the files in the 
cmake directory.
